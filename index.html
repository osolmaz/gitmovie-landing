<h1>GitMovie: Develop videos like software</h1>
<p>Imagine that YouTube and GitHub had a baby.</p>
<p>
The idea is simple enough:
<ul>
  <li>Develop entire videos by programming, without touching a video editor.</li>
  <li>Collaborate with others on a git repo, such as on GitHub.</li>
  <li>Connect it to GitMovie with a single click.</li>
  <li>Continuously deploy videos on permalinks, e.g. https://gitmovie.com/AwesomeUser/AwesomeVideo</li>
  <li>Auto-translate videos into other languages with machine translation, such as DeepL.</li>
  <li>Serve translations like how you would i18n software docs, e.g. https://gitmovie.com/de/AwesomeUser/AwesomeVideo</li>
  <li>And many more awesome features!</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  How would that even work? See some examples at <a href="https://voiceover.manim.community/en/stable/index.html">Manim Voiceover</a> website.
